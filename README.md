Intructions on how to play the 'SUDOKU' game:

1. You will be presented with a choice between "graphics settings":

   [1] Color
   [2] Text

NOTE: The Python IDLE supports only the text based version of the game, therefore PLEASE MAKE SURE to select option '[2] Text'.
If running an IDE such as Microsoft Visual Studio速, option '[1] Color' is permitted, since the '[1] Color' option is supported by Microsoft Visual Studio速. 
Option '[1] Color', is also supported on command-line interpreters, such as command prompt (cmd). 
If command prompt (cmd) is used, be sure to first type (without quotes and brackets):
'cd (the directory where main.py is)' 
and then 
'python main.py'

2. After, you will be presented with a choice to either play the game, solve a game puzzle, or to exit out of the game/program:

Play the Game [1]
Solve a Puzzle [2]
Exit [3]

Playing the game [1] will allow you to advance and open a new input menu for choosnig the game settings.
Solving a puzzle [2] will advance to a menu which will allow for you to print out varying game solutions.
Exit(ing) [3] the game will result in a prompt asking whether you want to kill (close) the game, or not.

Choose option 'Play the game [1]'.

3. Playing the game [1]: Two options will appear, allowing you to choose to either select a game level of your choice, or to play a random game level. 

[1] Select Level
[2] Random

Game level files are based on txt. files. They are located within the extracted 'SODUKU' folder. Within this folder, you can add your own level files, or manipulate the current files (if necessary).

[1] Select(ing) level: You will need to type in the name of a level (from a txt. based file) e.g. "3.txt", as located within the extracted 'SODUKU' folder.
[2] Random: A random level file will be loaded, allowing you to play the game. 

Choose option '[2] Random'.

4. You will now be presented with 'SODUKU' game board! The board complies to the same general rules of 'SODUKU'.

Choice example: The program will request of you to choose a row (in which to alter a specific value on the board) e.g. input = 1, followed by the column e.g. input = 2. 
                The above example will allow you to set a value for the position on row 1, column 2. 
		You can then input a valid number from the range of 1 - 9, when requested for the "Value:".

5. During gameplay, you will be presented with the choice to either continue playing, or not:

Keep playing? [Y/N]

The keyboard input of 'y/Y' will allow you to continue playing the game. 
The keyboard input of 'n/N' will result in a roll back to the main menu, where you will again be given the following options, as before:

Play the Game [1]
